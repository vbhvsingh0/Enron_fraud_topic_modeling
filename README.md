# Enron_fraud_topic_modeling

In this project I worked with text data, containing emails from Enron employees. The Enron scandal is a famous fraud case. Enron employees covered up the bad financial position of the company, thereby keeping the stock price artificially high. Enron employees sold their own stock options, and when the truth came out, Enron investors were left with nothing. The goal is to find all emails that mention specific words, such as "sell enron stock", "resell stock", "loss" etc.

Here I,
1) Processed Enron email data using pandas and NLTK for text cleaning and filtering emails containing specific stock-related terms.
2) Implemented LDA topic modeling with gensim to identify themes, clustering topics to catch suspicious activities within the company.
